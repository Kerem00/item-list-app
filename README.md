# Item List App
List anything using a name and a comment section.
## Usage
Download the source code, open a terminal inside source code folder and run with the command below.
```bash
python main.py
```
In Windows, to get rid of the CMD window that comes with the GUI, change the extention of `main.py` to `.pyw`.
### For .ui files
```bash
pyuic5 -x main.ui -o main.py
```
## TODO
* Dependency list is going to be added here.
* Import and Export will be functional.
* Setup will be created.
* Theme feature will be functional. (It is using the default Qt theme by default.)
* More commenting to source code will be done.
